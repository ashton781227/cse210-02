# Hilo
Here's where your hability to risk and win will be tested. We will give you an initial card with numbers from 1 to 13 and 300 points to start. Then you will guess if the next card will be higher or lower. If you choose correctly, you will be rewarded. On the other hand, we will remove some points if you're incorrect. If you reach 0 is game over.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
py hilo 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.
